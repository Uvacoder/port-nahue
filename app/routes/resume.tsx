                    A brief summary of my professional life.

                <p className='text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5'>
                    For the past 15 years, I have been a Full Stack developer,
                    and since mid-2014, I developed my DevOps skills. I love
                    traveling, rock music, and primarily enjoy life with my
                    fiance.
                </p>
                <p className='text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5'>
                    On a professional level, my experience goes from learning
                    the programming basics on Fox 2.6 with my father to manage a
                    physical data center on the local government and handle
                    multi-cloud environments with Azure and Amazon AWS.
                </p>
                <p className='text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5'>
                    I've also been developing my Full Stack skills with many
                    languages such as PHP, Python, Javascript, C#, and a lot of
                    well-known frameworks.

                <p className='text-sm leading-5 text-gray-500 mt-5'>
                    I can say I have experience with other aspects of technology
                    such as:

                        and its forks (mainly for querying, but I also did some
                        installations and essential management)

                    I am a constant and fast learner, always trying to improve
                    myself, personally and professionally. Also, I can't see
                    myself working without a Team, having one pushes me to be
                    better and to teach others what I've learned, and that feels
                    very rewarding. My native language is Spanish, and I'm also
                    fluent in English (to read, write, and talk).
